- Understand how to perform mathematical calculations in Python
- Learn how to write a program to calculate the percentage of a number in Python

Problem Description:

We are given a percentage value, and we want to find the percentage of a number (200 in this case) that corresponds to this value.

Solution:

Let's break down the solution into steps and understand how the code works.

Step 1: Reading Input from the User
We can read input from the user in Python using the input() function. Here's the code to do that:
In this code, we are using the input() function to get the percentage value from the user. The input() function reads user input as a string.

Step 2: Converting the Input to an Integer
Since the input() function reads the user input as a string, we need to convert it to an integer before performing mathematical calculations on it. We can use the int() function to convert the percentage value to an integer. Here's the code to do that:
In this code, we are using the int() function to convert the percentage variable to an integer.

Step 3: Performing Mathematical Calculations
Now that we have the percentage value as an integer, we can use it to calculate the percentage of the number 200 using the formula:
value = (percentage / 100) * number

Here's the code to calculate the percentage of 200:

In this code, we are using the formula to calculate the percentage of the number 200, and we are storing the result in the value variable.

Step 4: Displaying the Output
Finally, we need to display the calculated value to the user. We can use the print() function to do that. Here's the code to display the output:
In this code, we are using the print() function to display the calculated value.

For example, if the given percentage is p=50, the percent of 200

value = (percentage / 100) * number
value = (50 / 100) * 200
value = 0.5 * 200
value = 100
